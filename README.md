# **Keystroke Logging Demonstration**

## **Project Overview**

The **Keystroke Logging Demonstration** project provides hands-on exposure to how keyboard input events are captured at the operating system level. The project is designed strictly for **educational and defensive cybersecurity learning**, enabling learners to understand keystroke-based attack techniques so they can be detected and prevented in real-world environments.

The application captures:

* **Key Press**
* **Key Hold**
* **Key Release**

events and stores them in both **JSON format for structured analysis** and **text format for readable interpretation**. A **Tkinter-based GUI** is included to control execution ethically and responsibly.

## **Key Features**

* Real-time keystroke monitoring
* Captures press, hold, and release events
* Supports alphanumeric and special keys
* JSON-based structured logging
* Text-based readable logs
* GUI-controlled execution using Tkinter
* Ethical and educational implementation

## **Technologies Used**

* **Python**
* **pynput**
* **JSON**
* **File Handling**
* **Tkinter**
